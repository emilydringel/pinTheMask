# Interactive Devices: "Pin the Mask"Â Game

My art piece for this project is a "Pin the Tail on the Donkey" type game that replaces the donkey with a smiling face and the tail with a surgical face mask. Players use a minimalistic game cube with a button, joystick, and potentiometer (dial) to navigate the game. The game provides commentary on the current state of the COVID-19 pandemic, with varying mask regulations and usage.

The piece includes three sensors connected to an ESP32 which sends data to the computer screen through a serial connection. The sensor connections primarily use solderless wires, except for the button connection which required hand soldering. The internal wiring is hidden within a plywood box with 3 holes on top for the sensors and one on the side for the wire (created with http://old.makercase.com/, cut using a laser cutter, and held together with hot glue and painter's tape).
